            <div class="textbox">
                <div class="t1">Personality</div>Rebekah Mikaelson is erratic, spiteful and vindictive. She is very stubborn and refuses to budge if push comes to shove. Because of the heartbreak she has endured throughout the years, Rebekah has put up walls around her but she still finds herself falling for men as easy as they go. Rebekah grieved for a long time after her mother’s death. Despite her aggressive nature, she has shown to be emotionally fragile. Rebekah fears being left alone, and she doesn’t understand it when people are nice to her. All Rebekah wants is someone to care about her. She can be very punctual and quite good at organizing things. She likes to plan ahead but has no problem with being spontaneous also. She feels she has been let down one to many times and finds it hard to trust people in her life. Even her family have betrayed her and for that she hides many feelings behind herself. Also, the Original Sister is very much devoted to women’s power. She likes to stick up for girls as she feels it is a very male orientated world so she will do a lot to protect women from men if she can, she’s not really fan of the men club, not that much. Despite this somewhat feminist state, she craves a relationship and wishes to have a true love to speak of but often ends up heart broken and alone, however, right now she just doesn’t care about that, she realized that at some point her true love is going to be there and she will wait for him and she won’t look for that love. Now she has more appreciation for the human life than before but still sometimes she has her impulse. She can be  really nice when she wants to but again she can’t help to say what she is thinking and sometimes that can be brutal.<br><br>
                    <div class="t1">About</div><br>
                    Rebekah Mikaelson is the sole female Original Vampire and the second daughter of Mikael and Esther. She is the younger sister of Freya Mikaelson, Finn Mikaelson, Elijah Mikaelson and Kol Mikaelson and the younger half-sister of Niklaus Mikaelson, the elder sister of Henrik Mikaelson, and the aunt of an unnamed, unborn nephew - Freya’s son - and Niklaus’s daughter with Hayley Marshall, Hope Mikaelson. Throughout her millennium-long life, Rebekah’s actions and personality have been heavily influenced by her relationship with Klaus and her desire to live a normal, human life. She has also been romantically involved with a few people over time. In the 12th Century, she was in love with a vampire hunter named Alexander who was a member of the Brotherhood of the Five. In the late 19th and early 20th Century, she was in a relationship with Klaus’s protégé Marcel Gerard while she and her family lived in New Orleans. After she fled New Orleans with Klaus to escape her father Mikael, she was briefly in a relationship with Stefan Salvatore in Chicago during the early 1920’s, and because she chose Stefan over her half-brother, Klaus daggered her for ninety years in punishment for her perceived betrayal. Once she was undaggered in 2010, she had brief flings with both Stefan and Damon Salvatore before finding herself in a romantic relationship with a human, Matt Donovan. Shortly afterward, she followed her brothers Klaus and Elijah back to New Orleans, where they once again settled as a family, allowing her the opportunity to rekindle her relationship with Marcel. She frequently travels back to Mystic Falls to check in with the friends she made as well as making sure no harm has come to Matt.

                    <div class="t1">History</div><br>
                    Rebekah is the daughter of Mikael and Esther who were wealthy land owners from Eastern Europe. She is the sixth of seven siblings along with Klaus, Elijah, Freya, Kol, Finn and Henrik. Not much is known about Rebekah’s early life other than that she was born in the New World, where they lived in peace among the werewolves for twenty years. However during a full moon, when the werewolves were transforming, Klaus and his youngest brother Henrik snuck out to watch them. As the sun began to rise, se saw Klaus carrying Henrik’s lifeless body back into the village. He states that one of the wolves had mauled Henrik to death. Not wanting to lose another child, their mother Esther (The Original Witch) casts a spell, calling upon the sun for life and the white oak tree for immortality. However the spell led to some untimely acts. Unbeknownst to Rebekah and her siblings they drank wine laced with the blood of Tatia for dinner and afterwards Mikael drove his sword into their hearts. After their awakening Mikael forced his children to feed on a local villager, completing their transition into vampires. Later they began to realise their new gift had its weaknesses. The flowers that grew at the base of the white oak tree, vervain, burnt them and prevented compulsion. The sun burnt their skin making it impossible to walk in the daylight. They were unable to enter the homes of their neighbours without an invitation. Also their thirst was insatiable. Realizing that a wood carved from the white oak tree would be fatal to them, they burned the tree to the ground. After their mother died, Rebekah, Klaus and Elijah swore to each other that they would never turn on each other and would stick together as one “always and forever”

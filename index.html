                Dearest love of mine, there is not a star in the expanse of the universe that could shine as bright as you do. I hope that you have the best possible day and the sweetest dreams tonight. <br><br>
                <div class="t1">You Are Amazing</div><br>
                You are astonishing. Every time I look at you, I am breathless. You fill me with a euphoric feeling, and I can exhale again. I hope to have my breath taken away every day for the rest of my life. 
                <br><br>
                <div class="t1">You make me happy</div><br>
                The odds I would meet the most amazing woman in the world must have been one in a couple billion. Somehow, our destinies aligned, and all of the luck in the universe led me to you. I could love you forever and still never repay that debt to fate. 
                <br>
                My love for you is unconditional. I never thought I could experience love like this, but from the moment I met you, I knew my life would be forever changed. You turned me inside out and made me whole. 
                <br><br>
